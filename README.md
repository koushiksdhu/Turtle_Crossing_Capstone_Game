# Turtle Crossing Capstone Game

This project is a Turtle Crossing Capstone Game built using Python and the Turtle library. It is a fun and interactive game where players control a turtle to cross a busy road while avoiding oncoming cars. The game provides a challenging and enjoyable experience for players of all ages.

## Features

1. Game Interface: The application provides a graphical interface where players can see the turtle, cars, and the game area. The game area consists of a road with lanes for the turtle and cars to move.

2. Player Controls: The player controls the turtle using the keyboard arrow keys. The turtle moves in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

3. Car Movement: The game generates cars that move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds. The player must navigate the turtle across the road, avoiding collision with the cars.

4. Turtle Crossing: The player's objective is to safely guide the turtle to the other side of the road. Once the turtle successfully crosses the road, it advances to the next level with increased difficulty.

5. Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the turtle and the cars. Colliding with a car ends the game.

6. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each successful crossing. The score is displayed on the screen, and the game ends when the turtle collides with a car.

## Prerequisites

To run the Turtle Crossing Capstone Game, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher) installed on your computer.

## Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the Turtle Crossing Capstone Game:
   ```
   $ python main.py
   ```

4. The game window will open, displaying the turtle, cars, and the game area.

5. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the turtle. The turtle will start moving in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

6. The objective of the game is to guide the turtle safely across the road, avoiding collision with the cars.

7. Watch out for the cars moving horizontally across the screen. If the turtle collides with a car, the game will end.

8. Successfully guide the turtle to the other side of the road to score points and advance to the next level. The current score is displayed on the screen.

9. As the levels progress, the game becomes more challenging, with faster cars and more lanes to cross.

10. The game continues until the turtle collides with a car. The final score will be displayed on the screen.

11. To exit the game, close the game window or press the "Esc" key.

## Customization
